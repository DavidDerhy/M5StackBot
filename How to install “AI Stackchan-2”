This article describes a step-by-step installation procedure for “AI Stackchan-2”, a voice dictation AI system that utilizes Google Speech-to-Text to recognize and replay using OpenAI’s cloud service and generates real voice using VOICEVOX. Since the original GitHub documentation is in Japanese, I aim to provide an English version with detailed information to setup.
