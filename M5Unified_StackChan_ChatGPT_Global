Getting the ChatGPT API key
The method of obtaining a ChatGPT API key is as follows. (For details, please refer to the link at the bottom of this page.)

Access theOpenAI websiteand create an account. An email address and mobile phone number are required.
After creating an account, issue an API key. The API key is paid, but there is a free period and credits.
Usage
If you create the following two files at the root of the SD card, you can use it.
wifi.txt file: The file name is "wifi.txt", and the contents are as follows.
YOUR_WIFI_SSID
YOUR_WIFI_PASS

apikey.txt file: The file name is "apikey.txt", and the contents are as follows.
YOUR_OPENAI_APIKEY

If the M5Stack was previously connected to Wi-Fi, it will automatically connect to Wi-Fi without the need for an SD card.
In this case, access "http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/apikey" in your browser and set the API key.
(xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx is the IP address displayed when AI Stack Chan is started.)

You can set the role by accessing "http://xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx/role" in your browser.
(xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx is the IP address displayed when AI Stack Chan is started.)
If you send it without entering anything in the text area, the previously set role will be deleted.

Role information is automatically saved to spiffs.


You can get the currently set role by accessing "http://xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx/role_get" in your browser.

You can adjust the volume of the speaker.

Example:http://xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx/setting?volume=180
The value of volume is 0 to 255.

You can change the expression of AI Stack-chan to match the conversation content.
Please enter the following two lines as they are in the role settings.

Enclose the emotion type in parentheses, as in (Happy), and attach it to the beginning of the response.
The emotion types include Neutral, Happy, Sleepy, Doubt, Sad, and Angry.

When setting up other roles, please include these two lines at the end.
If possible, try using only these two lines.
Increasing the number of roles will make it more likely to fail.


Added a soliloquy mode. It speaks randomly at random intervals. It is fun when combined with the emotion expression function. Press button A to turn soliloquy mode on/off. Even in soliloquy mode, you can still talk to it from your smartphone as before.

It has a function to save the history of the last five conversations.

You need to separately prepare a speech recognition program. Pass text (UTF-8) with an HTTP command from the speech recognition program as follows (please pass the text after URL encoding):

http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/chat?text=hello

Replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX with the IP address of the displayed M5Stack at startup.


You can also access it using a browser in the same way as above.



Touching near the center of the screen of the M5Stack Core2 will stop Stack-chan's head from shaking.

Pressing button C on the M5Stack Core2 allows you to test speech synthesis.
